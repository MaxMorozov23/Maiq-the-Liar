## Maiq the Liar

This is a web application written in Vue.js.
Based on the well-known character of the series of "The Elder Scrolls" games.

At the moment, the application is being finalized and is only an light version of the project itself.

When you press the button, M'aiq says a random phrase from the games, but if he gets bored, he will say about it (reload the page and he will calm down).

### Update 0.1: Now M'aiq can talk.
